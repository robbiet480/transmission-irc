NOTE: currently needs NickServ to work

1) edit "transmission.conf" file

2) run "php transmission-irc.php" from the console (which is NOT a browser!)

3) connect to the (same) irc server, send private message to your bot
   example: "/msg TransBot --help"
   command syntax is the same as transmission-remote
   (command lines are simply passed over because transmission developers change the syntax too frequently)


1b) instead of the official transmission-remote you can use my wrapper named transmission-remote.php
    to see the added features run "php transmission-remote.php --help"
    to use it with the irc script replace exec parameter in the .conf file to "php transmission-remote.php"
